Project Description
-----------------------
This project exists to reduce the irritation of dealing with Android screen densities.  The goal is to integrate seamlessly with the gradle to export rasterized images for each Android screen density from an input set of SVG images.
(automatically resizing PNG/JPEGs to Android screen densities is a long-term goal but not recommended because of the loss in quality)

TODO:
-----------------------
1. Convert all projects to use JCommander for more standard command line handling.
2. Integrate with gradle as a task.
